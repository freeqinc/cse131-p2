Y U NO have automated tests?
============================

If you're running tests by hand, you're missing bugs and wasting time. Use Yuno.

Yuno lets you run more tests, much faster, much more often. Run a full regression suite for each commit. Run any test you want at any time. Let Yuno figure out what's broken, what's **still** broken, what you fixed, and what your fix just broke. Designed for `CSE 131 <http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/CSE131/>`_, it's customizable, cross-platform, and it helps you get a better grade.


A few features
--------------
Run every test in Phase 1, with diff output for failures::

    yuno run phase 1 --diff

Run a custom set of tests, then save them as a suite for later::

    yuno run all --ignore mallory/ eve/ --save trusted

Run a suite you made earlier (or got from someone else)::

    yuno run suite crazy_edge_cases

See everything that still needs fixing::

    yuno show failing

If your not-so-sober partner made some changes, it can help you find regressions::

    $ yuno run all
