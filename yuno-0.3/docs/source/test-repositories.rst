Test repositories
=================

Layout
------

Structure your repository any way you want, as long as answer files are always in the same directory as corresponding tests. By default, Yuno looks for files with :file:`.ans.out` and :file:`.rc` extensions in a repo named :file:`testcases/` next to :file:`yuno/`, but those values can be changed in the :doc:`configuration file <customize>`.

CSE 131
-------

Templates with the recommended layouts are available for `project 1 <https://github.com/bulatb/131-project1-testcases>`_ and `project 2 <https://github.com/bulatb/131-project2-testcases>`_. These layouts are compatible with older testing tools and work with :ref:`special Yuno features <run-by-phase-and-check>`.
